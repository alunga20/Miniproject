# HOMOLOGY MODELLING

---
- Also known as comparative modelling of proteins, refers to constructing an atomic-resolution model of protein

- Relies on the identification of one or more known protein structures likely to resemble the structure of query sequences.

- On production of an alignment that maps residues in the query sequence to residues in template sequence.

- Protein structures are more conserved than protein sequences amongst homologue but sequence falling below a 20% sequence identity can have different structure.

- Evolutionary related proteins have similar sequences and naturally occuring homologous proteins have similar protein structure.

- The sequence alignment and template structure are then used to produce a structural model of target, because protein structures are more conserved than DNA sequences and detectable levels of sequence similarity.

## **Principle;** 

- Quality of homology models is dependant on the quality of the sequence alignment and template structure.

- SWISS-MODEL workspace(used in reproducing this paper) is an integrated Web-based modeling expert system. 


- For a given target protein, a library of experimental protein structures is searched to identify suitable templates. 


- On the basis of a sequence alignment between the target protein and the template structure, a three-dimensional model for the target protein is generated. 


- Model quality assessment tools are used to estimate the reliability of the resulting models. 


- Homology modeling is currently the most accurate computational method to generate reliable structural models and is routinely used in many biological applications. 


- Typically, the computational effort for a modeling project is less than 2 h. However, this does not include the time required for visualization and interpretation of the model, which may vary depending on personal experience working with protein structures.
